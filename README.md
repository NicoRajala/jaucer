## Why should I use jaucer instead of SHA256?

1. jaucer is completely open-source and you can see all the code that it has. Most of those eas codes are closed-source and cannot be viewed by most people, so the code of some algorithms may be infected. But other than most, you can see/modify the code of jaucer the way you like and it makes it safer.
2. jaucer is still unknown and hackers don't know the code yet, so it is safer than most eas.

## What was the motivation to do jaucer?

For me it was the boresome that I had one night, so I wanted to do something that I have not done yet before.

## How to use jaucer?

1. Open jaucer
2. Type in the text you want to be encrypted to jaucer.
3. A notepad opens with the encrypted code.
4. Enjoy!

For now there has been a problem when closing jaucer, that it just opens again. So to close it just press (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) and then end the process in taskmgr.
